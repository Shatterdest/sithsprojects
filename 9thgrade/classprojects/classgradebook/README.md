File One: You will be creating one simple and one complex program. To
begin, create a file that has a variable “student” that is dictionary comprised
of a name:String, class:String, and grades: list. You will then create a
function that accepts grades as a parameter. The function will return the
average grade for the student. Print this value.

File Two: Using the knowledge gained in File One you will now move onto a
more complex project. You will be creating a program that allows a user to
continually input new student data that appends a student list with new
students. This project will have multiple levels of complexity based on your
comfort level.
Level 1 Must Include:
-Students List
-create a function that takes data and returns the average of that data
-function to create new student dictionary that includes the properties from
File One and an additional property called ‘average’ that uses the function
created in step 2.
-a continue_adding_students variable set to “Y”
-A While loop that runs as long as the contine_adding_students variable is
“Y”. Remember this is case sensitive.
-The while loop should use user input to get student_name, class, and a list
of grades. The while loop will run create student from step 3.
-While loop should print all of the students one at a time from the list and
ask if we want to continue adding students Y/N

Level 2: For those comfortable with Python
-create a function to get the class average. Print this class average after
the While loop has closed
