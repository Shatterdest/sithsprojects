You will be creating 3 programs across 3 files using data from a JSON file.
File One: You will take the data from the JSON file and you will iterate
through the list of pokemon and print each pokemons name

File Two: You will be receiving user input and filtering the list based on
Pokemon type. Your program must have error handling if the type is not
found. All pokemon matching the given type must be printed on separate
lines. Your program should contain the following
-Accept user input for a type
-develop a function that accepts a type parameter
-iterate through the pokemon data and find pokemon matching the type
-if no pokemon is found let the user know

File Three: This program is similar to the previous program but you will ask
the user to request a specific pokemon data entry. You will iterate through
the list and return all pokemon whose names match the user request. Print
all of the properties of the pokemon who are found this way and let the user
know when no pokemon are found.
